## Features

- **Simple Implementation**: Easy-to-understand code for beginners.
- **Predictive Model**: Utilizes regression techniques to predict house prices.
- **Python-Based**: Entirely written in Python, leveraging its powerful libraries for data analysis.

## Installation

To get started with the Simple Regression Model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple_regression_model.git
   cd simple_regression_model
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the regression model, run the `house_prices.py` script:

```bash
python house_prices.py
```

This script will load the dataset, train the regression model, and output the predicted house prices.

## API Documentation

The main functionality is encapsulated in the `house_prices.py` file. Key functions include:

- `load_data()`: Loads the dataset for training.
- `train_model()`: Trains the regression model using the dataset.
- `predict()`: Predicts house prices based on the trained model.

## Configuration

Currently, there are no configurable environment variables or options. Future updates may include configuration settings for model parameters.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.

## Testing

To run tests, ensure you have `pytest` installed, and execute:

```bash
pytest
```

This will run all tests and provide a report of the results.
